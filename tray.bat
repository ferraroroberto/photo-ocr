REM  PhotoOCR TRAY - tray icon that owns a long-lived service lifecycle
REM ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REM  CANONICAL TEMPLATE. Copy to `tray.bat` in a tray-resident app, then replace
REM  the four __PLACEHOLDER__ tokens (marked `=== ADAPT ===`). Everything else is
REM  the orphan-proof reclaim-then-start machinery and is copied verbatim, so a
REM  filled-in copy is byte-identical to every sister tray. Full reasoning:
REM  scaffold docs/windows-tray.md + project-scaffolding#29.
REM
REM  Launch this on login (Startup folder) for an always-on service.
REM
REM  Idempotent:
REM    tray.bat              -> no-op if a PhotoOCR tray is already running
REM    tray.bat --restart    -> stop the running tray (and its service tree) and
REM                             start a fresh one
REM
REM  Detection matches the tray process by command line + this project's .venv
REM  path via CIM, then kills BY PID with /T. We never blanket-kill pythonw, so
REM  sister-app trays and any other python processes are untouched.
REM
REM  The full detect -> kill -> reclaim -> start -> verify lifecycle lives in
REM  the ONE shared, machine-local tray_lifecycle.ps1 owned by fleet-config
REM  (project-scaffolding#153) -- exposed at %USERPROFILE%\.claude\tray\ by
REM  fleet-config's install.ps1 junction, shelled to with -File, NOT in
REM  cmd-side `for /f` output capture or inline `powershell -Command "..."`.
REM  Both cmd shapes have failed under non-interactive nested callers (Git Bash
REM  -> `cmd /c "tray.bat --restart"`, or a finisher skill's Bash tool): detect
REM  output came back empty, nothing was killed, and --restart silently degraded
REM  to a plain start that adopted the stale webapp and reported success.
REM  Delegating once to PowerShell makes behavior identical from any caller and
REM  lets stale git_sha verification fail loudly (project-scaffolding#54).
REM
REM  --restart is orphan-proof: besides killing the tray subtree, it reclaims
REM  this app's owned service ports by their owning PID, regardless of process
REM  parentage. A service child that got detached from its tray (a stale process
REM  from an earlier run) would otherwise survive a subtree kill, block the fresh
REM  tray from binding, and keep serving the old build while the restart reports
REM  success. The reclaim is scoped to processes whose CommandLine is under THIS
REM  repo's .venv (NOT the process image path): a venv-launched pythonw re-execs
REM  the base interpreter, so .Path reports the shared base python while only the
REM  CommandLine still carries the .venv path. Matching the image path would miss
REM  the real service; the CommandLine scope keeps the sweep on THIS repo only.
REM
REM  Mutex-shared ports (a port another app may legitimately own) must NOT go in
REM  the 8444 reclaim list -- reclaiming one would kill the sibling.
REM ============================================================================

setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
REM  Clear an APP_NAME the caller already carries: the usual restart route is an
REM  agent in a session that inherited the old leaked value (app-launcher#963).
set "APP_NAME="
set "SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0"

cd /d "%SCRIPT_DIR%" || exit /b 1

REM === ADAPT (1/4): short app name, used in messages + the start window title ===
REM  Namespaced, never a bare APP_NAME: setlocal hides a variable from the
REM  calling console but NOT from children, so the whole tray -> service chain
REM  inherits it, and so does every session and app it spawns -- where APP_NAME
REM  is another project's own config key (app-launcher#963).
set "TRAY_APP_NAME=PhotoOCR"
REM === ADAPT (2/4): the args python is started with to launch the tray,
REM     e.g. "launcher.py tray"  or  "-m tray" ===

REM  -- junctioned by fleet-config's install.ps1, never vendored per-app.
set "TRAY_PS=%USERPROFILE%/.claude/tray/tray_lifecycle.ps1"
REM  --restart without the helper stays a hard error: the orphan-proof restart
REM  is fleet-config's job, and degrading it to a plain start would adopt the
REM  stale build, see project-scaffolding#54. A plain start has no such risk, so
REM  it jumps to the standalone start at the bottom. Two flat ifs, not a nested
REM  block: an `exit /b 1` nested inside a block that also holds a `goto` comes
REM  back as exit code 0 under cmd.exe (project-scaffolding#345).

)

REM === ADAPT (4/4): replace 8444 with this tray's exclusively-owned
REM     ports as a comma list, e.g. 8445,8446 . Exclude any mutex-shared port. ===
set "OWNED_PORTS=8444"
REM PhotoOCR-specific: this webapp is HTTPS-only (tailscale cert issued for the
REM tailnet MagicDNS name, per project-scaffolding#89 / this repo's CLAUDE.md).
REM Leave VERSION_URL blank: post-project-scaffolding#147 the helper's default
REM restart probe is https://127.0.0.1:<first-owned-port>/api/version, and its
REM loopback cert-bypass skips TLS name validation for 127.0.0.1, so the app now
REM answers the loopback probe correctly. The old tailnet-hostname override was a
REM pre-#147 workaround for the loopback-SAN mismatch and is now obsolete -- worse,
REM the #147 bypass is loopback-only, so a non-loopback override fails cert trust.
set "VERSION_URL="

REM %~dp0 (SCRIPT_DIR) always ends in a trailing backslash. A quoted CLI arg
REM ending "...\" is misparsed by Windows argv parsing: an odd run of
REM backslashes before the closing quote escapes it instead of closing the
REM string, so everything past -ScriptDir gets swallowed into one argument
REM (observed: "positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument
REM 'tray -VersionUrl \"'"). Strip the trailing backslash before passing.

REM  Standalone start (project-scaffolding#345): the shared helper is missing,
REM  e.g. this app was moved to a PC that has none of the other fleet repos, and
REM  a plain start was asked for. Launch the tray straight from this repo's .venv
REM  and exit 0. No detect/adopt here: the tray's own single-instance guard
REM  (app/tray/single_instance.py) stops a duplicate, and --restart is refused
REM  above, so nothing in this path can mask a stale build.
:standalone_start
REM  This repo sets SCRIPT_DIR_ARG further down (after the helper check), so the
REM  jump above skips it; derive it here with the same de-slash form.

echo NOTE: shared tray helper not found, starting the %TRAY_APP_NAME% tray standalone - --restart needs fleet-config.
REM  Start-Process (as the shared helper does), not cmd `start`: `start` lets the
REM  tray inherit this script's stdout pipe, so a caller capturing our output (an
REM  agent shell, a finisher skill) would block until the tray exits. Values go
REM  through the environment, so no quoting nests inside the -Command string.
